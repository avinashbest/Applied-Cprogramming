/*
Consider the following pseudo code. What is the total 
number of multiplications to be performed?

D = 2
for i = 1 to n do
    for j = i to n do
        for k = i + 1 to n do
            D = D * 3

(A). Half of the product of the 3 consecutive integers
(B). One-Third of the product of the 3 consecutive integers
(C). One-Sixth of the product of the 3 consecutive integers => Correct
(D). None of the above.
